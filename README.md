# N341-Client-Side-Web-Programming
## Intro
PU CSCI-N431 Student Course Pages, syllabus, including assignments(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), assignment requirement and expectations, study guide, etc.
## Extra Info
- The Assignment Instruction can be found inside [assignmentRequirement](./assignmentRequirement "assignment instruction").
- I only did the minimum and some of the Challenges. But all of them meet requirement format-wise, and follows the course guideline strictly.
- I will post study guide **SOON** that might help anyone with quizzes and exams, and most importantly, help getting a better understanding with the knowledge in the course as I will try to make it as brain-friendly as possible.
- I posted it here to shared it and hopefully help and inspire people, which is all I want to do. 
### But ... 
- **PLEASE DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, COPY ANY PART OF THE CODE. I am OK with it to be honest, but you might recieve penalty for plagiarism, etc. Trust me, it is not worth it**
- Plus, I am not a distinguished computer scientist, don't let my code limit your mind. Let your mind spark fly!

## That's it, Happy Coding! Computer Science Prevails!
